Use hard links when you need a duplicate reference to a file that remains functional even if the original file's directory entry is deleted.

Example: Maintaining multiple access points to critical configuration files.


Soft links can point to files or directories on different filesystems, making them suitable for linking resources that span multiple partitions or network drives.
Example: Linking a file on /mnt/external_drive to a directory in /home/user.
